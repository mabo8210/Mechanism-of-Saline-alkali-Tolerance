**Title**:Artificial Intelligence Identification of Japonica Rice varieties Based on Raman Spectroscopic Identification Mechanism of Saline-alkali Tolerance

**Abstract**: Rice is regarded as the preferred crop for saline-alkali soil improvement by researchers. At present, the identification method for saline-alkali tolerance of rice varieties requires researcher to conduct tedious field investigations based on growth indicators. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective technical means to quickly and accurately identify saline-alkali tolerance of rice varieties. Study used 20 japonica rice varieties with three types of saline-alkali tolerance as test materials, by analyzing the identification mechanism of salt-alkali tolerance in Raman spectrum of japonica rice varieties, seven characteristic spectral peaks closely related to salt-alkali tolerance were identified. Various algorithms in Python are used for data standardization, baseline elimination, extraction of characteristic spectral peaks, detection of peaks characteristic information and data noise reduction. Three identification models were established to confirm the highest accuracy of CapsNets identification model, which could provide technical support and reference for breeding saline-alkali resistant japonica rice varieties.
